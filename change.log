020-12-17 0030 Scrapped original code
           0130 Created functional set creator for all possible combinations
                given the current variable cells (this is 2**n possibilities,
                where n == the number of cells with an unknown state)
           0220 corrected the set creator so it would properly use copies of
                of the current possible outcomes
           0235 convert p_row and p_shape to sets of tuples and return the
                intersect
           0240 get rid of the sets and return a list of p_row elements found in
                p_shape
           0250 fork to new project from sandbox
           0345 README and changelog built -- first commit
           0420 Cleaned up comments and added docstring for possible_rows()
           0450 Split out the row and shape generation to separate functions
                Added validation for row.
